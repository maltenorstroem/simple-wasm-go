/**
 * SAP icons have been created with a friendly, yet elegant style that is consistent in terms of size,
 * stroke and balance. The icons are tailored for simple and direct user interaction, using metaphors that are easy to
 * understand. Each icon has been hand-crafted, hand-hinted, and aligned in font format. The icons are essentially
 * vector graphics which can be resized easily without compromising their appearance.
